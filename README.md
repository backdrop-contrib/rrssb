# Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons

![RRSSB](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/rrssb/blob/1.x-2.x/images/rrssb.png "RRSSB examples")

## Description

Social sharing buttons that you can drop into any website with attractive
SVG-based icons, small download, and browser compatibility. No 3rd-party scripts.

You can choose to add the buttons to the end of certain node types or use the
block provided to put them wherever you want in your Layouts.

Originally designed as share buttons (visitor is encouraged to share your page
on their social stream), the buttons can also be used as follow buttons,
where the visitor is encouraged to visit your social stream.

## Installation

- Install and enable this module using the official
  [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)

  reduced server load and smaller caches.

- Prefix text such as "follow us" that automatically reflows and resizes.
