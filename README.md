# Ridiculously Responsive Social Sharing Buttons

## Description

Social sharing buttons that you can drop into any website with attractive 
SVG-based icons, small download, and browser compatibility. No 3rd-party scripts.

You can choose to add the buttons to the end of certain node types or use the 
block provided to put them wherever you want in your Layouts.

Originally designed as share buttons (visitor is encouraged to share your page 
on their social stream), the buttons can equally be used as follow buttons, 
where the visitor is encouraged to visit your social stream.
